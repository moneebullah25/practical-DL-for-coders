You’ll see that fast.ai’s way of teaching is very different to what you might be used to, if you did a technical degree at university. Nearly all technical subjects at university are taught “bottom up”: start with basic foundations, and gradually work up to complete useful solutions to real world problems. But we go “top down”: start with complete useful solutions to real world problems, and gradually work down to the basic foundations. Education experts recommend this approach for more effective learning. For more information, have a look at this article that discusses the fast.ai teaching philosophy: [Providing a Good Education in Deep Learning](https://www.fast.ai/2016/10/08/teaching-philosophy/).
